## Application description
For movie lovers trying to get a comprehensive view of a movie without having to read through tens of thousands of reviews from several different platforms, TopReview is a review aggregation website that will gather review/summary data about movies from the open-source realm and give the general sentiment of a movie across different platforms such as IMDB, RottenTomatoes, LetterBox, and more. Unlike Metacritic, which only has numerical scores for movie and film criteria, TopReview will give users an all-encompassing text review.
