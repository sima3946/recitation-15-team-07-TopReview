Front-end for login and registration are finished. For the home page, there is a front-end for the navigations bars as well as the footer and search bar, 
however due to some reassessments, settings as well as the profile page for the side navigation bar have been put on hold. The review page is being worked on
by Gunhi, as well the back-end is currently the focus of it. With all of this, we are roughly 1/4 of the way through the entire project and now hope to 
pick up the pace in order to finish on time.

API enpdpoint route/calls are still being developed in order to get movies loaded into database from TMDb and one other movie review database/api which is TBD. Brandon is no longer in the group which removes TopReview's search functionality from the development process. Profile page is still being configured (both back and front end). At this point, both backend and frontend are being worked on and project is 2/4 complete.

Everythhing is pretty much complete. Still working on (debugging) correctly retrieving review data from SQL database and filtering it through ChatGPT API. Apart form that presentation deliverables are 85% done and now all that is left is to continue testing, polish up slight details on the front end and figure out who is presenting and delivering what according to the shared slides and "script". Also need to make sure website is fully functional in order to ensure demo during presentation is accurate and smooth.
