Front-end for login and registration are finished. For the home page, there is a front-end for the navigations bars as well as the footer and search bar, 
however due to some reassessments, settings as well as the profile page for the side navigation bar have been put on hold. The review page is being worked on
by Gunhi, as well the back-end is currently the focus of it. With all of this, we are roughly 1/4 of the way through the entire project and now hope to 
pick up the pace in order to finish on time.
