Second meeting:
Project: TopReview
Attendees: Siranush, Kira, Tyler, Alex, Gunhi, Brandon
Date&Time: 4/15: 2:00-3:00 pm 

Agenda:
    Group conflicts: 
        Resolution + what are our next steps
    Finalize plans of who is working on what
        Specifically back-end vs front-end + possible redistribution of some roles
    API calls check in 
    Front-end check in
        Mull over rubric and what we should have
        GOALS
    Commits and individual contribution
        Work starts now! 
        Make sure you’re working on what you need to work on
            If you have issues, please tell us!
                Utilize the group chat so that everyone knows what you’re working on/having trouble with!
            Checkin on Monday/Tuesday to see where everyone is
        Remember to single out a specific commit that you will be presenting
        Branching vs forking
    Gentle reminders:
        Only have two-three weeks for this project left
        If you can’t get something done, let us know
        Stricter deadlines 
        Everyone has to present their individual contributions, and we aren’t in a position to be able to present for others!
    Questions/comments/concerns?


Notes:
    Update the project board for what needs to be done for the backend
        Most likely will also need to do this for front-end as well
        Ensure that the buttons for login page redirect to the correct place
    Alex + Tyler continue on registration and login
    Home page:
        APIs needed:
            OMDb/TMDb API calls (with posting the top 5 popular from each? This is in the ice box)
            Gunhi will be taking care of getting the movies into the cards (the API call that will be doing that, however if needed, will also help with it!)
        Search bar will need to be saved into the database (the input)
            Save the search history, but how much of that will actually be saved will have to be configured later
    Get all API calls and populate the database with the movies
        Limited to getting 1k a day for the API calls 
    Movies searched for that cannot be found, which means this is an edge case that needs to be handled 
        A way to look through the movies and not search for them?
        Randomly display 5 movies for the cards instead of recently viewed 
        Message: “could not find the movie”
    Search bar action is still trying to be found (may need to go to a different page – or inline API)
    Need to make more TODOs and then redistribute them
        This covers all of the backend stuff as well
    APIs
        OMDB API KEY: 239f295a
        Need one to have ChatGPT summarize the movie reviews
        Need to get the movies
        API key generated: whose and where do we need to put that
        Need to give sentimental value to the reviews
        login/register API calls 
        This includes the user database
    Committing everything:
        Sira will update everyone on how many commits each person has
        Pull requests when merging the main branch with the branch
        Just another note: each user story needs to be on its own branch!!
        Make sure to link the issue with the branch
    URL: localhost:3000
    Movies offered instead of recently reviewed
        This can be done later if we have time
    Kira will redo the project board
    As of right now, all front-end pages exist 
        Review Page is currently on the back burner and needs the API to be done so that we can do

Outcomes:
    Key decisions:
        Tyler: testing
        Sira/Kira: finishing up the sidebar and search bar
            FOOTER IS DONE
            Kira can do home page/review page API calls
            Sidebar: login, logout, profile, settings, home
        Alex: sentiment API
        Gunhi + Brandon: API call that populates the movie database
            Only doing two
            https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/movie-reviews-api/1/overview 
        Review Page is currently on the back burner and needs the API to be done so that we can do
        Movies offered instead of recently reviewed
            This can be done later if we have time
            Randomly display five movies for the cards instead of recently viewed
