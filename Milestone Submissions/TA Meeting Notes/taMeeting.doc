    Meeting Notes:
        Added
    Functional Features:
        Working features: 
            The login page:
            Once the user registers, the user credentials are stored in the database. The user can log in, which can be checked through
            the profile page. 
            The register page:
            The user must have a password and user name that fits the criteria to register. Once registered, this will take them to the login page.
            The home page:
            Once logged in, the home page will be rendered with five movie cards, and a navigation bar will be placed on the side. 
            The movie cards display the photo and name of the movie. The review page will be rendered if the movie cards are clicked. 
            Through the navigation bar, they may refresh the page, check their profile, or log out.
            The review page:
            Once a movie is picked from the home page, the review page will be rendered. On the review page, the user may see the same movie card
            as before with a series of reviews. The reviews are categorized as positive, neutral, and negative. The reviews are generated through 
            chatGPT.

        Todo: 
            The home page has an issue where the movie cards are displayed under the navigation bar. The navigation bar also has an issue where 
            the dropdown menu is not popping up. 

    Main Branch
        All the inactive branches are merged into "main."
        Active branch: api_calls. This branch is used to figure out the problem with the home page.
